1: NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT GOALS 
 
1.1. Policies and Strategies Context 
Kenya is reorienting development programs to align policies and strategies with the overarching 
goal of becoming a globally competitive and prosperous nation with a high quality of life by 2030. 
This will be attained through a sustained GDP growth rate of 10% on average annually to create 
wealth and employment. This reorientation is a response to the need to attain goals and targets 
set in vision 2030 development blueprint, Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), 
Comprehensive African Agricultural Development Programme (CAADP) and to make gains in the 
regional food markets opened with the common regional market integration. Feeding on these 
multi sartorial policies and strategies are several agriculture sector development policies for 
Livestock, Dairy, National Agricultural Research System and National Food Security and Nutrition 
among others. 
 
The development vision of agriculture sector is transformation into innovative, commercially-
oriented, competitive and modern sector with a growth rate of 7% annually to generate an 
additional K.shs. 90 billion increase in the country’s GDP. Within the agriculture sector, dairy sub 
sector valued at over K.Shs. 100 billion worth by 2007 is the single largest component, larger in 
value than horticulture (K.Shs. 65.2 billion) or tea (K.Shs. 46.8 billion). Dairy sub sector is the 
agricultural sub-sector experiencing one of the highest growths, estimated at 3 to 4 % annually 
with contribution to the national GDP estimated at 4%, this being part of 10 to 12% livestock 
contributes and of 40% agriculture contributes.  
 
Milk based enterprises are attractive in Kenya, supporting over 1.8 million smallholder 
households engaged in dairy production. Building on the huge economic prospects of dairy 
production and trade, the dairy policy envisions a competitive dairy industry regionally and 
globally that will develop and promote an efficient and self-sustaining industry. The overarching 
goal of dairy policy is to improve standards of living of Kenyans by ensuring for farmers food 
security and increasing real incomes and productivity. The policy specific objectives for economic 
growth in the 21st century and beyond are: 
 
i. 
To improve the productivity and competitiveness of Kenya’s dairy and dairy products; 
ii. 
To positively contribute to the livelihoods of milk producing households; 
iii. 
To increase domestic consumption of milk and milk products; 
iv. 
To contribute to national  food and nutrition security  
v. 
To transform the dairy industry into a net exporter of dairy animals and products; 
vi. 
To maximize dairy exports in the regional and global markets 
 
2 
vii. 
To re-orient milk processing towards long life dairy products. 
 
1.2. Strategic Goals for the Dairy Master Plan 
The timing of this dairy master plan comes at the expiry of implementation timeframe for 1991 
dairy master plan; at reorientation of country’s development programmes and strategies to attain 
development goals set in the vision 2030 development blueprint and in the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs); and at the entry into common regional market integration. These 
present new challenges and opportunities in the dairy sub sector, necessitating aligning dairy 
development programmes and strategies with the new development aspirations and responding 
to the emerging challenges in order to steer further development in the sub sector.  
 
The masterplan proposes action plans necessary for the transformations, policy changes and 
development strategies needed to further steer dairy development in line with the other national 
development aspirations. The action plans are proposed while remaining aware of, and 
responsive to the emerging challenges. The specific objectives of the analysis are: 
 
i. 
To formulate relevant strategies and programs for the development of the dairy industry 
and design a mechanism for their implementation, monitoring and evaluation by all 
stakeholders while leaving room for the introduction and adoption of new technologies.  
ii. 
Provide the government with sound justification for a more efficient allocation of the 
development and recurrent budget to the sector based on analysis and projections. 
iii. 
Provide a roadmap for public private partnerships and promote such partnerships in order 
to private sector investment in the dairy sector nationally. 
iv. 
Produce simple and clear pragmatic framework and identify tools for implementing 
interventions for impacts in all components of the dairy value chain. 
v. 
Address cross-cutting and cross–sectoral thematic issues of importance in dairy value 
chain development.

2: THE DAIRY MASTER PLAN DEVELOPMENT PROCESS 
The development of dairy master plan went through processes of desktop literature review study, 
ground-truthing field survey, information synthesis of and scenario analyses of transformation 
options and consultation with stakeholders in the dairy value chain. These processes informed 
the benchmarking of Kenyan dairy industry transformation and SWOT analysis. 
 
2.1. The Development Processes 
The development of dairy master plan went through four major processes. Firstly, desktop study, 
reviewing the literature and sourcing relevant data from diverse sources, mainly the Ministry of 
Livestock Development and Kenya Dairy Board. Secondly, ground-truthing field survey in major 
dairy producing areas. Thirdly, synthesis of information obtained from the literature and ground-
true-thing field surveys and scenario analyses of transformation options. Fourthly, consultation 
with stakeholders in the dairy value chain about the synthesised information and scenario 
analyses for transformation options. Stakeholders’ consultation were organised at regional levels 
in Eldoret, Nakuru, Nyeri and Mombosa and national level in Nairobi. Two national forums were 
organized to chart the transformation pathway.  
 
Finally the consulting team prepared the dairy master plan strategic actions and implementation 
framework to steer dairy sub sector development to 2030. The strategic action plan is informed by 
the industry situation at national and regional levels and stakeholders’ concerns. The reports of 
dairy sub sector situational analysis and stakeholder consultation forums form first volume of this 
dairy master plan. 
 
2.2. Benchmarking Kenyan Dairy Industry Transformation 
The transformation of Kenyan dairy industry into a globally competitive dairy value chain 
envisaged in the national development goals can be benchmarked to dairy industries in China, 
India and Australia. All these countries have in common with Kenya a low cost, rainfed pasture 
dairy production system. China and India have in common with Kenya dairy sub sector dominated 
by smallholders, strong tradition for dairy consumption and production that is integral part of 
farming systems, growth rate of about 3% annually, rapidly rising per capita milk consumption at 
a doubling rate and increasing milk production through increases in cattle population rather than 
numbers. Australia has in common with Kenya dairy industry contributing significantly to the 
country’s economy.  
 
The projected likely level of growths to occur in per capita milk consumption in China and India 
under “Livestock Revolution’’ phenomenon against realised growth changes in Kenyan and 
Australian dairy industries are illustrated in Table 1. For a time of 20 year period, the per capita 
 
4 
milk consumption in China and India will grow by a factor of 1.7 to 2.0 comparable to Kenyan 
growth rate by a factor 1.7. Over the same length of time period, Australia doubled animal milk 
productivity from 2850 to 5750 litres a year, a growth Kenya can set to achieve. India with 
dominant smallholder milk production and trade do process 38% of total milk produced, 
comparable to 32% in Kenya, but with potential to transform progressively towards the 75% in 
Australian. India has 40 to 50% of total milk produced processed into value added products 
including dairy sweets, ghee and soured milk.

Growth in milk consumption demand over a 20 year period doubles in India and China, which 
translated for Kenya would be doubling of present 111 litres milk per capita consumption to 220 
litres by 2030. With human population projected to reach 58 million by 2030, the total milk 
demand projects to 12.76 billion litres. With this milk demand, the balance in milk demand and 
supply projected for 2010 to 2030 is illustrated in Figure 1.  
 
Domestic milk supply at medium growth rate (3.5%) and high growth rate (4.2%) suggest that 
demand will continue to outstrip supply by 31.8 to 43.5% for medium growth rate and 16.8 to 
32.8% for high growth rate. Satisfying the 220 litres per capita milk consumption by 2030 requires 
strategic actions to more than double milk productivity if the country is to satisfy the growing milk 
demands from domestic production without unsustainable explosion in population of milking 
animals kept.

Table 2 presents the projected milk productivity increases needed. Greatest productivity 
increases will be needed in dairy cattle by 150% and in dairy goats by 115.5% relative to 64% in 
the zebu cattle and 29.9% in camels. These corresponds to an average annual growth rate of 
4.71% in dairy cattle, 3.83% in dairy goats, 2.50% in zebu cattle and 1.32% in camels. These will 
be realised with annual population growth rates of 2.48% for dairy cattle from 3,403,000 to 
5,551,388, 8.85% for dairy goats from 175,000 to 936,268, 2.55% in camels from 1,132,000 to 
1,872,967 and 1.21% for zebu cattle from 10,119,000 to 12,881,958.

Presently achieved milk productivity in some herds better managed herds utilizing innovations 
adequately, appropriately and efficiently in feeding, health and breeding suggest the productivity 
levels needed are achievable with a transformation in production and trade. There are annual 
milk productivity of 5,285 litres in Friesian, 4,617 litres in Ayrshire, 3402 litres in Guernsey and 
 
6 
3159 litres in Jersey. A wide range in individual animal productivity of 7 to 45 litres for dairy cows, 
4 to 12 litres for camels and 0.35 to 4 litres for dairy goats indicate room for improvement.

APPENDIX 1: THE ACTORS IN THE DAIRY VALUE CHAIN IN KENYA 
 
The strategic vision and mission of this dairy master plan is to develop a sustainable and globally 
competitive dairy value chain for wealth creation and high quality life while maintaining 
compliance with requirements for high standards of public and environmental health. A value 
chain is a series of sequential activities that add more value to the product at each step in the 
process that the product passes through. Figure 1 depicts the distinct steps in the Kenyan dairy 
value chain. They include Input and service providers; Milk producers; Collection, Chilling and 
Bulking group; Processors; Retailers and Distributors; and Consumers. Input and service 
providers include public and private sector players. They provide a range of services including 
feed supply, veterinary and AI services, breeding stock, extension services, testing and regulatory 
services. Access to these services is crucial to efficient functioning of a dairy value chain, 
especially for smallholder producers and traders.

APPENDIX 2: PROJECTED SHIFTS IN THE PROPORTION OF MILK MARKETED THROUGH 
MARKETING OUTLETS TO 2030 
 
Based on the 2005 estimated milk volumes and proportion through each channels, the 2010 
situation is projected and on their basis to set targets for 2030. The un-shaded values represent 
the present share of milk marketed through each channel and the shaded values represent the 
targets for changes by 2030. Presently the proportion of milk production marketed is 65% leaving 
35% for home consumption. Of the 2.925 billion litres of milk marketed, 45% (1.316 billion litres) 
is handled in the formal market or through the processors. The remaining 55% (1.609 billion 
litres) is handled in informal market outlets dominated by hawkers. The targeted action is to shift 
the proportion of marketed milk in the informal market outlet from 55% in 2010 to 35% (3.350 
billion litres) in 2030. The shift targeted is reducing from 35% (1.575 billion litres) in 2010 to 20% 
(2.552 billion) in 2030 for milk consumed at home of the total production, in order to shift milk 
through markets from 65% in 2010 to 75% (9.57billion litres) in 2030.
