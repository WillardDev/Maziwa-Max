        "Targeting dairy interventions in Kenya: A guide for development planners, researchers and extension workers.  \nIntroduction\nThis easy-to-use guide to effective targeting of selected dairy interventions in Kenya is intended for use by anyone involved \nin dairy farming in the country, such as development planners, researchers, service providers, suppliers of dairy inputs \nand extension workers. The guide answers the question often faced by these workers: where is their proposed intervention \nmost ",
        "likely to be adopted? \nUsing a combination of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) mapping methods and economic regression techniques, \nthis guide shows where and under what circumstances dairy technologies are most likely to succeed.\nStructure of the guide\nThe guide is divided into three sections. The first section deals with concepts, rationale and methodologies for targeting \ndairy interventions. It also explains, with examples, how to use the guide. \nThe second section presents the targeti",
        "ng maps for various dairy interventions. A total of eleven dairy interventions are \nconsidered in this guide. For each, a map shows relative probability of adoption together with a description of the innovation \nand background information. Also presented are the socio-economic, biophysical and agro-climatic characteristics that \npredispose uptake of each intervention. \nThe third section presents some policy-relevant research results in three topical areas: \n\u2022 Cost of milk production \n\u2022 Evaluatio",
        "n and assessment of alternative milk preservation techniques \n\u2022 Employment generation in the dairy marketing chain. \nWhat is targeting of interventions?\nTargeting of interventions involves the systematic identification of domains where the probability of adoption is high \nand where promotional efforts can most effectively be focused. Targeting can be based on various approaches, such as \nidentification of sub-populations of people, but this guide is based on identification of geographical areas.",
        " It uses spatial \ndata to predict the likelihood of adoption of innovations by individual decision makers, i.e. farmers.\nEffective targeting by geographical area requires four key questions to be answered: \n\u2022 Can the intervention work in this area?\n\u2022 Is there demand for the intervention in this area? \n\u2022 What is the probability of adoption in this area?\n\u2022 If the intervention is adopted, what impact will be achieved? \nImpact is created when the intervention solves existing significant constraints ",
        "faced by the farmers or creates new \nopportunities, and thus contributes to enhanced productivity and profitability which can alleviate poverty \u2013 by providing \ncash income or improving household nutritional status. Potential uptake of innovation is expressed in the form of \nprobabilities: where probability is estimated at 30%, it means that on average 30 out of every 100 farmers in the defined \ndomain will adopt the intervention once it is disseminated. \n1"

        "Targeting dairy interventions in Kenya: A guide for development planners, researchers and extension workers.  \nWhy targeting is important\nEffective targeting increases the success rate of dairy development interventions. People involved in dissemination activities \n- whether from the public or private sectors - want to be assured that their efforts and investments in dissemination activities \nwill result in adoption and create the required impact. In this guide, targeting matches selected dairy ",
        "interventions with \nthe geographical areas to which they are most suited and where impacts will be greatest. \nLikelihood of adoption is affected by geo-spatial factors, such as annual precipitation and temperatures, human population \ndensity, and socio-economic factors, such as household incomes, labour availability, experience and education of the \nhousehold head, size of land and market access amongst others. These socioeconomic factors (such as wealth, scale of \noperation, age of farmer, degr",
        "ee of intensification, ethnicity, or economic viability of enterprise) can be used to target \nbetter agricultural interventions and improve distribution of impacts. The inclusion of social and economic factors helps \nto addresses the questions of where interventions can make a major contribution to alleviating poverty in ways that are \nsocially equitable, ecologically sound and economically efficient. For example, concentration of intensive dairying beyond \na certain point can cause harmful nutr",
        "ient loading and targeting can help create an appropriate balance of crop-dairy \nsystems (Utiger et al., 2000, de Haan et al., 1997). Many development projects are applying these approaches for targeting \npro-poor investments and other equity considerations: Baltenweck et al., (2005) for example, use spatial and non-spatial \ntargeting approaches to introduce pro-poor approaches in a project funded by the International Fund for Agricultural \nDevelopment (IFAD) in Kenya. \nApproaches to targeting\nD",
        "epending on the availability of data and information, two approaches to targeting are possible: observation-based and \ncriteria-based. \nObservation-based targeting\nThis involved observing where a particular innovation has been adopted, plotting these sites on a map and identifying \nwhich common characteristics the sites share. Targeting of the intervention can then be directed to other areas that share \nthese same characteristics. \nThe method of observation based technology mapping has been desc",
        "ribed by (Staal et al., 2002) and follows these steps:\n1. Household and other characteristics from survey data and GIS derived data are used in a statistical model (see logistic \nregression model described in appendix 1) to predict adoption of the dairy technology. This model identifies significant \ncharacteristics of adopting farmers and uses this to predict probability of adoption. NB: T raditional technology adoption \nmodels often use only survey-derived data for all variables, some of which ",
        "are difficult to interpret and cannot be usefully \nmapped. Often representative numbers are used for variables such as district. \n2. Having predicted the model with GIS and survey data, we predict a second model using only the significant GIS-\nderived variables, with all other survey factors held constant at their mean. The two models have been compared and found \nto be more or less the same in explanatory and predictive power. However, the second model, given its variable GIS data, \ncan be used",
        " for spatial prediction of adoption.     \n3. This second model is mapped.\n2"

        "  \nMilk preservation is the process of preventing deterioration of milk quality by either maintaining low temperatures, as \nin milk coolers, or adding chemical preservatives. Lactoperoxidase (LPS) falls in the latter category and is a chemical that \nbuilds on the natural antibacterial effects in raw milk. \nIn Kenya milk has traditionally been preserved in cold chains. This was especially true when the Kenya Cooperative \nCreameries (KCC) enjoyed a monopoly in milk marketing in Kenya and ran milk ",
        "coolers in different parts of the country. \nFollowing the liberalization of the dairy sector and the entry of other players in the milk marketing, most of these \ncoolers have become dilapidated through many years of disuse.  Although coolers can contribute significantly to reducing \nspoilage, they require high levels of technical expertise and investment to maintain, and often prove to be uneconomical, \nparticularly where quantities of milk sold are small.  During the period that milk marketing ",
        "has been liberalized, chemical \npreservatives have also been used extensively \u2013 albeit illegally - mostly by milk traders transporting small quantities of \nmilk to the market. \nThere is concern about misuse of chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide in milk preservation by some traders. Thus, there \nis a need for dissemination of ethically acceptable and technically appropriate milk preservation methods, such as LPS. \nAlthough use of LPS is not currently permitted in Kenya, its use has been approved",
        " by the FAO/WHO Joint Expert \nCommittee on Food Additives (JECFA) and the Codex Alimentarius Commission. This process is natural and should not \nto be confused with the use of the banned and harmful chemical hydrogen peroxide. Economic viability and policy issues \nsurrounding the use of LPS for milk preservation are discussed further in Section 3. \nCriteria expected to increase likelihood of adoption of milk preservation methods:\n\u2022 Availability of a milk surplus: Where production exceeds demand,",
        " there will be a marketable surplus that needs to be \nmoved elsewhere for sale. In these cases it is likely that the point of production is far from the point of sale and methods \nto extend shelf life are needed.  Milk surplus was estimated and divisions with the highest surpluses (50% of total) were \nconsidered most likely to use milk preservation.\n\u2022 Areas far from the road:  Where producers are far from the road, it is likely that the milk travels further, and takes longer, \nto reach the point",

Using the road network, \ndistances from the road was calculated.  25% of the area, representing sites furthest from roads, was considered most likely \nto benefit from milk preservation.\n28Why preserve milk ?\n\u2022 Milk is a good medium of growth for various microbes, some of which are pathogenic.\n\u2022 To prevent deterioration of quality and increase the shelf life.\n\u2022 To maintain quality of milk along the value chain, part",

Technology is an important driver \nof dairy development in Kenya because increasing pressure on available land dictates that growth will come more from \nincreased producti",
        "vity than expansion in the scale of the dairy enterprise, such as through more land under cultivation \nor increasing size of herds of low productivity animals. But technology alone is not sufficient to sustain development in \ndairy and it has to be underpinned by appropriate and supportive policies. Indeed, the enacting and implementation of \nappropriate dairy policies would themselves be important drivers of the technology adoption process. This section looks \nat three key aspects of dairy prod",

The aspects examined are:\n\u2022 Cost of milk production\n\u2022 Milk preservation along the production to marketing channel \n\u2022 Employment generation in dairy activities\nCost of milk production\nReliable estimates of the cost of milk production are important to dairy industry stakeholders including farmers, processors, \npolicy makers and private dairy development agencies. This information is importan",
        "t for decision-making related to \ninvestment in dairy development relative to other enterprises, and for the design of policies to support smallholder dairy \ndevelopment. Moreover, persistent complaints by farmers that producer prices do not cover cost of milk production \nare a further justification to identify reliable estimates of the cost of milk production. Farmers and policy makers need \na dependable benchmark upon which to base their milk supply decisions; while in a market where prices ha",
        "ve been \ndecontrolled, quantities supplied will be based on market prices, production decisions are influenced in the long term by \ncosts of production relative to market prices. Policy makers can use this information to determine what tariffs to levy on \nimported dairy products to bring parity between domestic prices and prevailing world prices.\nThe data\nData for the cost estimates were obtained during in-depth studies of selected representative dairy farms in Kiambu, \nNakuru and Nyandarua dist",
        "ricts between October 1997 and March 2000. A total of 21 farm households were surveyed \nin Kiambu and 11 each for Nakuru and Nyandarua. A longitudinal survey was done during which each farm was visited \ntwice weekly over some 14 months to obtain daily records of milk production and sales figures, quantities and prices of \ninputs used in the dairy enterprise, and other relevant data (SDP 2004b; Staal et al., 2003). \nNo two farms are exactly the same in terms of farmer characteristics, managerial ",
        "skills, technology practices and access to \nresources and the cost of milk production will vary according to these differences. To estimate cost of milk production, we \nenvisaged three farm models for dairy enterprises that were deemed to be broadly representative of dairy farms in Kenya. \nThese categories are described below:\ni. Intensive production system: In this production system land holdings are smallest, stall-feeding is the main feeding \npractice and supplementation with purchased inputs",

Based on the detailed daily h",
        "ousehold data, the dairy enterprise is demonstrated to provide above-\nnormal profits, meaning that returns are higher than those available through alternative rural wage labour. This is true for \na range of dairy production practices from intensive stall-feeding systems to extensive grazing systems. The understanding \nthat farmers also capture additional but unmeasured benefits, such as from the use of manure and from the insurance and \nfinancial values of livestock assets, further strengthens t",
        "heir returns and competitiveness. The resilience of smallholder dairy \nfarming as a primary provider of livelihoods in many rural areas of Kenya cannot be reasonably questioned.\nResults from other studies (see Staal et al, 2000) underline the important role that road infrastructure plays, particularly in \nthe informal market that dominates the dairy sub-sector. These have shown that farmers who are 75 kilometres or more from \nNairobi can receive 22% less for their milk compared to farmers closer",

Moreover, for each additional \nkilometre of poor feeder road that separates a farm from the main road, milk price is reduced by almost KSh0.50 per litre, \nor about 3% per kilometre. The analysis also showed that simply upgrading the poor feeder roads to good murram roads \ncould reduce transport costs on those roads by 30%, and raise prices paid to farmers accordingly. Poor roads also significantly \nreduce farmer access to important support services, such as animal health and",

        "m data, and JICA 2003 for total agricultural labour figures\nIncome and employment effects at milk market level\nApproximately 6 million litres of milk are traded daily in Kenya through both formal and informal small-scale and large-scale \nprocessors and traders. Beyond the farm-level, processing and marketing of milk and other dairy products offer numerous \nother employment and income earning opportunities for the various participants in the milk supply chain. These include \ntransporters, mobile ",
        "milk traders, milk bars and shops/kiosks, small processors, service providers such as vehicle repairs, \nsecurity firms and catering outlets. Mobile milk traders do not have fixed business premises. Milk collection from producers \nis mainly on foot, by bicycle or public transport.\nMost small-scale traders handle some 50-120 litres of raw milk daily. T raders with milk bars have fixed premises and mainly \nsell both un-pasteurised and fermented liquid milk. Besides family labour, paid employees are",
        " actively involved in running \nthe milk bars. \nSmall processors in Kenya mostly process and sell pasteurised milk, either as wholesalers and/or retailers, with a small proportion \nof milk devoted to yoghurt and cheese production. They are much fewer in proportion to other cadres of milk traders.\nLabour requirements in small-scale milk marketing activities include milk collection, transportation, processing and sale, \ncreating direct and indirect employment. Direct employees are those who are occ",
        "upied with milk marketing and processing \non a daily basis and include the farmer, his/her family and paid labour.  Indirect employees are those involved in providing \nservices to the dairy industry, e.g. feed providers or artisans repairing farm equipment, bicycles, etc. The overall number of \nboth direct and indirect jobs created in the marketing segment of the supply chain varied from 14 to 20 for every 1,000 litres \ntraded on a daily basis, depending on type and scale of enterprise (Table 6)",
        ". This suggests that a significant number of jobs \nare created considering the volume of milk that is traded via various intermediaries daily.\nOn average, informal milk marketing generates 18 jobs for every 1,000 litres of milk that is handled daily; this includes 15 \ndirect job opportunities and three indirect jobs. The formal sector generates less employment per 1,000 litres of milk handled \non a daily basis (total of 15) with 14 direct jobs and one indirect job. Scaling out the employment eff",
        "ects to cover the whole \ncountry, formal milk processing and marketing generates about 19, 000 jobs compared to the informal marketing that creates \nmore than 41,000 employment opportunities to yield a gross total of about 60,000 jobs. \nFurther, these are relatively well remunerated jobs. From this study, it is estimated that formal employment in milk processing \nand marketing provides an average monthly wage of KSh 11, 936 ($150) while informal market agents earn an average of \nKSh 8,992 ($125)",
        ", both much higher than the Government\u2019s minimum wage guideline of $43.  \n39"
